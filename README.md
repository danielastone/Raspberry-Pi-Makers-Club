# 🌱 Raspberry Pi Plant Watering System

A smart soil moisture monitoring system that sends notifications when your plants need watering.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project combines:
- **Soil moisture sensor** to measure plant hydration
- **Simulation model** to predict watering needs
- **Email notifications** to alert when plants need water
- **Raspberry Pi** as the control system

## 👥 Team
